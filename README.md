# Cyber Training Module for CAP Cadet Encampment

## PURPOSE

Establish training curriculum to provide orientation/introductory-level cybersecurity awareness to cadets as part of the CAP cadet encampment.

## DISCUSSION

To further the cyber component of the CAP aerospace education program, garner interest in the cyber career field and CAP cyber-related cadet activities, and to generally promote fundamental cybersecurity awareness, a 1-hour block of instruction is recommended for addition to the cadet encampment curriculum.

Time and space constraints for the curriculum precludes the use of computers for the cadets.  Challenges may be introduced to the cadets throughout the presentation such as open-ended questions and discussion about encounters cadets have experienced online that present potential cybersecurity risks \(phishing emails, fake malware alerts while browsing, etc.\).

The training content should be a combination of individual safe computing practices \(being mindful to de-conflict any future cyber training that may be implemented at the local unit level to not repeat content already presented\); the linkage between individual safe computing practices and the larger picture of cybersecurity on the national level; cyber career exploration in military, government, and enterprise settings; and a brief overview of available opportunities for cyber competition within CAP.
